      "- **Description:** Super Mario 64 is a groundbreaking 3D platformer that set new standards for the genre. In this game, players control Mario as he embarks on a quest to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser. It introduced innovative gameplay mechanics such as free-roaming 3D environments and various power-ups, which have since become staples in platforming games.\n",

    "## Understanding Tool Call Traces\n",
    "\n",
    "The UdaPlay agent operates in a multi-step reasoning loop that often involves calling one or more tools.  \n",
    "The tool trace printed in the previous cells helps illustrate *how* the agent reasons and *why* it selects each tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what to look for in the trace:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Model-Initiated Tool Calls\n",
    "During the reasoning loop, the model may produce an `AIMessage` containing a list of `tool_calls`.  \n",
    "This indicates that the LLM decided it needs external information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical entry looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Calling tool: retrieve_game with args: {\"query\": \"...\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows:\n",
    "- **which** tool was selected  \n",
    "- **why** it was chosen (via the arguments)  \n",
    "- the agent’s internal decision-making process  \n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with modern agent frameworks (OpenAI tool calling, LangChain tools, LangGraph nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tool Execution Results\n",
    "After a tool call, the state machine returns a `ToolMessage` showing the actual output of the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: TOOL RESULT from retrieve_game\n",
    "\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes:\n",
    "- retrieved documents\n",
    "- metadata returned by the tool\n",
    "- structured game data from the vector database or web search\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM uses these results to inform its next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Multi-Tool Paths\n",
    "Some questions produce only a single tool call (e.g., retrieving a game description).  \n",
    "Others may trigger a fallback pattern, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `retrieve_game`  \n",
    "2. `evaluate_retrieval` (model checks whether the results are relevant)  \n",
    "3. `game_web_search` (if local data was insufficient)\n",
    "\n",
    "The trace makes this process transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Why These Traces Matter\n",
    "Tool call traces are one of the most important diagnostic tools when developing agent systems.  \n",
    "They reveal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- whether the agent is selecting the right tool  \n",
    "- whether the tool APIs are behaving as expected  \n",
    "- whether the agent can recover from weak retrieval  \n",
    "- how the model chains information across steps  \n",
    "\n",
    "These traces mirror debugging workflows used in production agentic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The printed tool call trace provides a window into the agent’s internal decision-making loop.  \n",
    "Understanding this trace is essential for debugging, optimization, and future extensions of the agentic architecture.\n"

    "2. decide which tool(s) to call  \n",
    "3. incorporate retrieved evidence  \n",

    "### 2. Tool-Based Reasoning (RAG + Web Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent uses three core tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. `retrieve_game`**\n",
    "Queries the local ChromaDB vector store for semantically relevant games.  \n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- fast retrieval  \n",
    "- grounded responses  \n",
    "- transparent metadata  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. `evaluate_retrieval`**\n",
    "Allows the agent to self-assess whether retrieved documents are relevant enough.  \n",
    "This is a common pattern in real RAG pipelines where retrieval quality must be validated before the LLM relies on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. `game_web_search`**\n",
    "Provides access to up-to-date or external information when local data is insufficient.  \n",
    "This hybrid setup (local RAG + external search) is the prevailing pattern in production agent systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. State Machine Architecture for Deterministic Control\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is implemented as a **state machine**, giving:\n",
    "- deterministic transitions between reasoning steps,  \n",
    "- full transparency of intermediate tool calls,  \n",
    "- debuggable state snapshots (`run.get_final_state()`),  \n",
    "- support for multi-step tool usage in a controlled flow.\n",

    "\n",
    "The agent now supports **session-based memory**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each session ID corresponds to a dedicated in-memory message buffer.\n",
    "- Subsequent queries in the same session build on the agent’s prior responses.\n",
    "- The agent retains context such as previously discussed games or facts.\n",
    "- Memory resets when a new session ID is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **short-term memory**, meaning it persists across multiple queries within the same session, but does **not** persist across restarts or different sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design enables multi-turn conversations while keeping the architecture simple and modular.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5. Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The final answer is returned as standard natural language text.  \n",
    "This keeps the notebook:\n",
    "- easy to read,\n",
    "- easy to debug,\n",
    "- and ideal for exploratory development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the system does not yet enforce a structured schema (e.g., via Pydantic), the modular tool design makes it straightforward to add structured output in the future if needed.\n",

    "### 6. Alignment With Real-World Agentic Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The UdaPlay agent implements several patterns that directly match real-world agent design:\n",

    "- **Think → Decide → Retrieve → Evaluate → Synthesize** loop  \n",
    "- Hybrid RAG architecture (local + web search)  \n",
    "- Explicit tool routing  \n",
    "- Deterministic state transitions  \n",
    "- Session-scoped conversational memory  \n",
    "- Transparent tool traces for debugging  \n",
    "- Clean separation between LLM reasoning and data/tool operations  \n",

    "These principles reflect the architectures used in production-grade assistants, copilots, and automated research agents across industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The UdaPlay agent is intentionally designed to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular** — tools, memory, and LLM layers separated  \n",
    "- **Transparent** — full tool trace visibility  \n",
    "- **Stateful** — session-based memory to support multi-turn conversation  \n",
    "- **Hybrid** — combining vector search and real-time web search  \n",
    "- **Extensible** — easy to add new tools, memory modules, or output schemas  \n",

    "## Current Limitations of the UdaPlay Agent\n",

    "Although the UdaPlay agent demonstrates multi-step reasoning, tool use, and short-term session memory, it still has several limitations that are important for understanding the boundaries of the current design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. No Long-Term or Cross-Session Memory\n",
    "Session-based memory is supported (via session IDs), but:\n",
    "- memory does not persist beyond the current session,\n",
    "- memory is not stored to disk or a database,\n",

    "- guaranteed field consistency (e.g., game name, year, platform),\n",
    "- machine-parseable outputs for APIs or monitoring tools.\n",

    "- reconcile conflicting web sources,\n",
    "- filter noise or irrelevant hits.\n",

    "- tools always return data,\n",
    "- the vector store is reachable.\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. No Multi-Agent or Supervisor Routing\n",
    "The system uses a single agent loop.  \n",
    "It does not:\n",
    "- delegate tasks to sub-agents,\n",
    "- use a supervisor model,\n",
    "- split tasks into planning/execution phases.\n",
